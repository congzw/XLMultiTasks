## Why I Build It

I build this extention when I was in college. We had limited WiFi data allowance, it was slow and worked only till 12:30AM. Keeping these things in mind I build this extension.

**I no more use this extension and there is no further development from my side**. Although, anyone willing to do any further development is free to open issues and make PRs. Least I can do is review and merge them.
